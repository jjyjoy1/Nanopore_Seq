Real-World Example Tools
For a more complete solution, you might use specialized tools like:

Nanopolish or Tombo: For detecting modifications from raw signal

EpiNano: Specifically designed for RNA modification detection
# Example EpiNano workflow
python /path/to/epinano/epinano_main.py detect --reads aligned_reads.bam --ref reference.fa --output epinano_output

MINES (Modification Identification using Nanopore Sequencing):
# MINES workflow
mines predict -r rRNA_reference.fa -b aligned_reads.bam -o mines_output

xPore for differential modification analysis:
# xPore workflow
xpore diffmod --config config.yml


These tools work directly with the raw signal data or the signal-aligned reads to detect modifications, then output tables of modification probabilities that can be used for machine learning classification of tissue types or cancer status.
