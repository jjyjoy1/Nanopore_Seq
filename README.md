Hybrid Nanopore-Illumina Bacterial Genome Assembly Pipeline

I've created several of workflows, conatining a comprehensive Snakemake pipeline for hybrid bacterial genome assembly using both Nanopore and Illumina data, direct RNA sequencing, and long read RNA-Seq analysis for cancer genomics(1. align, identify, and quantify full-length transcripts; 2. Splicing events detection; 3. Structural variant analysis; 4. Allele-specific expression. ). 

Pipeline Components
Snakefile - Contains the complete workflow with the following steps:

Quality control for both Nanopore (NanoPlot, Filtlong) and Illumina (fastp) reads
   Nanopore reads: Quality assessment with NanoPlot and filtering with Filtlong
   Illumina reads: Quality control and adapter trimming with fastp
Initial assembly with Flye using Nanopore long reads
First polishing round with Pilon using Illumina reads to correct base errors
Second polishing with Racon and Medaka using Nanopore reads for structural improvements
Quality assessment with QUAST and BUSCO
   Assembly statistics with QUAST
   Genome completeness assessment with BUSCO

Software Requirements
Snakemake (v7.0.0+)
Python (v3.8+)
NanoPlot
Filtlong
fastp
Flye
BWA
Samtools
Pilon
Minimap2
Racon
Medaka
QUAST
BUSCO

Configuration File - Customizable YAML file to specify:

Sample information (Nanopore and Illumina read paths)
Estimated genome size
BUSCO lineage for your specific bacterial species
Resource allocation parameters

Key Features

Modularity: Each step is isolated, making it easy to restart from any point if a step fails
Scalability: Works with multiple samples in parallel
Resource Management: Configurable thread allocation for each step
Comprehensive QC: Quality reports at multiple stages to monitor assembly improvement


Direct RNA sequencing is an advanced technology that allows scientists to sequence RNA molecules directly without converting them to cDNA first. This approach is particularly valuable for identifying post-transcriptional modifications on ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which can serve as biomarkers for tissue types and disease states like cancer.
The process works through several key mechanisms:

Direct sequencing captures RNA modifications in their native state by analyzing changes in electrical signals as RNA passes through nanopores, allowing detection of methylation and other chemical modifications.
rRNA molecules contain numerous modification sites that vary between different tissue types and can be altered in cancer cells, creating unique "fingerprints."
These modification patterns are analyzed using machine learning algorithms that identify tissue-specific and cancer-associated signatures.
The technology can distinguish normal from cancerous tissue based on consistent differences in modification patterns, potentially enabling early cancer detection from liquid biopsies.
