Hybrid Nanopore-Illumina Bacterial Genome Assembly Pipeline
I've created a comprehensive Snakemake pipeline for hybrid bacterial genome assembly using both Nanopore and Illumina data. 
This approach effectively addresses the higher error rate of Nanopore sequencing while leveraging its long-read advantages.

Pipeline Components

Snakefile - Contains the complete workflow with the following steps:

Quality control for both Nanopore (NanoPlot, Filtlong) and Illumina (fastp) reads
   Nanopore reads: Quality assessment with NanoPlot and filtering with Filtlong
   Illumina reads: Quality control and adapter trimming with fastp
Initial assembly with Flye using Nanopore long reads
First polishing round with Pilon using Illumina reads to correct base errors
Second polishing with Racon and Medaka using Nanopore reads for structural improvements
Quality assessment with QUAST and BUSCO
   Assembly statistics with QUAST
   Genome completeness assessment with BUSCO

Software Requirements
Snakemake (v7.0.0+)
Python (v3.8+)
NanoPlot
Filtlong
fastp
Flye
BWA
Samtools
Pilon
Minimap2
Racon
Medaka
QUAST
BUSCO



Configuration File - Customizable YAML file to specify:

Sample information (Nanopore and Illumina read paths)
Estimated genome size
BUSCO lineage for your specific bacterial species
Resource allocation parameters

Key Features

Modularity: Each step is isolated, making it easy to restart from any point if a step fails
Scalability: Works with multiple samples in parallel
Resource Management: Configurable thread allocation for each step
Comprehensive QC: Quality reports at multiple stages to monitor assembly improvement
